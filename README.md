# Welcome to Freeworld!

Freeworld is a family owned server within the popular Microsoft game Minecraft.

## History

The server was previously maintained and operated by reMARCable until it was decided to suspended its operations in 2014. During it's peak, the server reached up to hundreds of players from around the world. To this day, the Freeworld server has a Discord channel made up of its past players that continue to tighten a lifetime bond.

## Mission

The mission of Freeworld is to continue its legacy and to build a newer and more sophisticated server. In which we hope, will create newer relationships amongst the players.
